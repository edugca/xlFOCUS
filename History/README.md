# **xlFOCUS (v. 0.41)**																		
																		
This spreadsheet exposes examples of how to fetch data from economic data webservices, including FOCUS (market expectations), SGS and ipeadata (economic indicators), SCR (credit data), SPI (payments system), and more.																		
It is intended to be used by researchers and the general public. It is NOT a product of the BCB, nor it is maintained by that institution. Use at your own risk!																		
It is totally free and its code is open!																		
																		
## **TIPS**																		
																		
* Most recent version should be found in the webpage below:																		
https://github.com/edugca/xlFOCUS																		
																		
* To update from a previous version, just replace the old version of this spreadsheet with this one.
To update in your own spreadsheets, you need to open each one of them in the VBA Editor and replace the module "xlFOCUS" with its current version embedded in this spreadsheet.
If you are updating from a version older than v. 0.4, you need to also replace the module "JsonConverter" by the current version of the module "xlFOCUS_JsonConverter" also embedded in this spreadsheet.
If you are updating from a version as old as at least v. 0.4, you need to also replace the module "xlFOCUS_JsonConverter" by its current version also embedded in this spreadsheet.
																	
																		
* To use these functions in your own spreadsheet, use this spreadsheet as a model, it is EASIER!																		
* To use these functions in your own spreadsheet, use this spreadsheet as a model, it is EASIER!
Alternatively, copy to your spreadsheet the VBA modules named xlFOCUS and xlFOCUS_JsonConverter, both embedded in this spreadsheet.
The JsonConverter module is part of the "VBA-JSON" project developed by Tim Hall and available at the website below. The xlFOCUS_JsonConverter module is a slight modification of v2.3.1. so as to simplify its use in this tool.

1) With your spreadsheet open, make sure macros are enabled and the Developer tab is displayed. In the links below, you learn how to do that:

2) In the ribbon, click on Developer tab, then on "Visual Basic".													


3) Drag the VBA modules "xlFOCUS" and "xlFOCUS_JsonConverter" from this spreadsheet to your spreadsheet. Now, close the VBA Editor. You're ready to use xlFOCUS!																	
																					
* These functions rely on fetching data from online webservices, which can be unavailable at times. So, when designing your spreadsheet, consider copying function results and pasting them as values.																		
																		
* There should be a function for each resource covered by this tool. One can find the metadata on their webpages:

FOCUS	https://olinda.bcb.gov.br/olinda/servico/Expectativas/versao/v1/aplicacao#!/recursos

SCR	https://olinda.bcb.gov.br/olinda/servico/taxaJuros/versao/v2/aplicacao#!/recursos

SGS	https://dadosabertos.bcb.gov.br/dataset/20542-saldo-da-carteira-de-credito-com-recursos-livres---total/resource/6e2b0c97-afab-4790-b8aa-b9542923cf88

SPI	https://olinda.bcb.gov.br/olinda/servico/SPI/versao/v1/aplicacao#!/recursos

MercadoImobiliario	https://dadosabertos.bcb.gov.br/dataset/informacoes-do-mercado-imobiliario

ipeadata	http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/api/																	

* If your query is not working, try to build it on the webpage above. If the server is down, then all functions will fail to fetch data!																		
																		
* Beware that the BCB's  webservices are case sensitive, that is, "IPCA" works but "ipca" does not.																		
																		
* To read large JSON files generated by the webservices (tested with FOCUS, SCR and SPI), download them to a folder and then read them with the function xlFOCUS_ReadJSONFile.																		
																		
* There are some known limitations with functions that directly query the webservices. Basically, avoid returning much data in a single function call and avoid many function calls:																		
	* 10,000 is the maximum number of observations returned by each function call																	
	* In general, the limitations of each webservice also apply to the queries demanded by this tool's functions. We recommend you to read their documentation.																
																		
## **Version history**																	
																		
v 0.1 (2021-12-16)

* First release.																		
																		
v 0.2 (2021-12-19)

* More instructions on how to implement these resources on the user's spreadsheet.												
* New function to read JSON files: xlFOCUS_ReadJSONFile.																		
																		
v 0.3 (2021-12-26)

* Fixed the encoding of the text read by the function xlFOCUS_ReadJSONFile. Now, it is correctly set to UTF-8.									
* New function to get data from the SGS system: xlFOCUS_SGS.															
* New function to read JSON script returned from the SGS system: xlFOCUS_SGS_ReadJSON.												
* New function to get data from the SCR system: xlFOCUS_SCR_TaxasDeJurosDiario.													


v 0.4 (2022-01-01)

* Major change: instead of using Excel's WEBSERVICE function to fetch data, xlFOCUS now uses the object MSXML2.serverXMLHTTP, which allows for larger query results to be fetched!
* All references to non-standard libraries in the VBA code are now late-binding, so there is no need to make reference to them in the user's spreadsheets.
* New function to fetch data from any webservice: xlFOCUS_WEBSERVICE. It does not suffer from the same data amount limitations imposed by Excel's function WEBSERVICE, but it is still limited by Excel's maximum string size.
* New function to read a JSON script from BCB's webservice: xlFOCUS_ReadJSONFromWEBSERVICE. It does not suffer from neither the same data amount limitations imposed by Excel's function WEBSERVICE nor from Excel's maximum string size.
* Function xlFOCUS_SGS_ReadJSON now returns N/A for missing observations.
* New function to get time series data from the ipeadata webservice: xlFOCUS_ipeadata.
* New function to get the metadata from a time series from the ipeadata webservice: xlFOCUS_ipeadata_Metadados.
* New function to get JSON data from the ipeadata webservice: xlFOCUS_ipeadata_ReadJSON.
* New function to get JSON data from the MercadoImobiliario webservice of the BCB: xlFOCUS_MercadoImobiliario.
* New function to get data from the SCR system: xlFOCUS_SCR_TaxasDeJurosMensal.

v 0.41 (2022-01-01)

* In the presence of old dates (< 1900-01-01), ipeadata functions return dates formatted as text 'yyyy-MM-dd'.
