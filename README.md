xlFOCUS: fetch BCB's FOCUS survey data to Excel

This spreadsheet exposes examples of how to fetch data from the BCB's "Expectativas de Mercado" survey, also known as FOCUS.
It is intended to be used by researchers and the general public. It is NOT a product of the BCB, nor it is maintained by that institution. Use at your own risk!
It is totally free and its code is open!

TIPS															

* Most recent version should be found in this webpage!

* To update from a previous version, just replace the old version of this spreadsheet with this one. To update in your own spreadsheets, you need to open each one of them in the VBA Editor and replace the module "xlFOCUS" with its current version embedded in this spreadsheet.

* To use these functions in your own spreadsheet, use this spreadsheet as a model, it is easier!
Alternatively, make a reference in your spreadsheet to the "Microsoft Scripting Runtime" library and copy to your spreadsheet the VBA modules named xlFOCUS and JsonConverter, both embedded in this spreadsheet. In the tab "General" of the spreadsheet, one can find step-by-step instructions on how to do that.
The JsonConverter module is part of the "VBA-JSON" project developed by Tim Hall and available at the website below. Tested on v2.3.1.

* These functions rely on Excel's WEBSERVICE function (available from Excel 2013 onwards), which can be quite unstable. So, when designing your spreadsheet, remember to save it constantly.															
															
* There is a function for each resource provided by the FOCUS's webservice. One can find the metadata on its webpage:

* If your query is not working, try to build it on the webpage above. If the server is down, then all functions will fail to fetch data!														
* Beware that the FOCUS webservice is case sensitive, that is, "IPCA" works but "ipca" does not.

* To read large JSON files generated by the FOCUS website, download them to a folder and then read them with the function xlFOCUS_ReadJSONFile.

* There are some known limitations with functions that directly query the FOCUS webservice. Basically, avoid returning much data in a single function call and avoid many function calls:															
	* 10,000 is the maximum number of observations returned by each function call														
	* 32,767 is the maximum number of characters of the JSON script returned by each function call														
	* 2,048 is the maximum number of characters of the URL path accessed by each function call
